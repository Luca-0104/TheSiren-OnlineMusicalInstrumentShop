                'The MEINL Jam Cajon with fixed internal snares is perfect for playing on the go. Its compact design is lightweight and easy to carry to drum circles or acoustic gigs. Crafted in Europe from Baltic birch wood, the Jam Cajon has great low end punch when played near the center and dishes out snare drum "slap" sounds when striking the top corners of the playing surface. The dual internal snares are fitted to rest against the inside of the frontplate for a sensitive response. These sounds are perfect for providing the rhythmic foundation for acoustic music.',   # m description
