                "Developed under the direction of internationally renowned trumpet artist Eric Miyashiro, the brand new 'EM' trumpet series is also an upgraded version of the model released 17 years ago. The power and responsiveness of the original trumpet has been retained, and the piston cylinder, which is at the heart of the instrument, has been upgraded. Every part has been carefully re-examined and optimized as needed to improve playability and overall control in the upper register. The EM trumpet continues to evolve to meet the ever-changing needs of the world's leading players.",   # m description
