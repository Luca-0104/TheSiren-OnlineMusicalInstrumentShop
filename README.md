# The Siren - Online Musical Instrument Shop

## 1.1 Overview
This is an introduction about the online musical instrument shop ”The Siren”. The main structure of this website
is separated into two portals: the client end and the staff end. These two portals have different responsibilities,
which form a complete online shop where customers can purchase products and staffs can manage orders and
products. This project is a web-based application which can be accessed via a URL. The website has provided
functions for customers to have a pleasant shopping experience and interfaces for staffs to manage this online
instrument shop. Even though users may access this website on many kinds of devices, interfaces of this website
can automatically adapt different display resolutions. This document is to guide you on how to use our website
functionalities.

This is an Alipay account for sandbox environment, which is provided by Alipay company for developer to
test the payment API. However, all the functionalities provided are totally the same as an real Alipay account,
except that no real money will be involved in transaction. After delivering this project to our client, the sandbox
environment can be switched to an production environment in our system easily.
To be more specific, when you are testing the payment function of our website, you will be redirect to the Alipay
to finish your final step of money transaction, where you should use the Alipay account we have provided you
to finish your payment.

NOTICE: There are some special cases you may encounter with when experiencing our payment functions.

* Special Case 1
The subtotal of your testing order may exceed the balance remained in this provided Alipay account.
There are two possible solutions. One is that you can just change to another order, which requires less
payment. Another solution is that you can contact us with email ”zhe.liu1@ucdconnect.ie”, then we will
configure that Alipay account again to increase the balance.
* Special Case 2
Sometimes, you cannot test any payment related functionalities due to the maintenance of this sandbox
environment conducted by Alipay company. However, any other period of time are all available.
